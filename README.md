# Resume Builder

We all have faced this issue where we have been trying to create a resume and we just can't figure out the template or maybe we are away from our system and we need to give our `Resume` to some recruiter but we don't have access to our `Resume` (consideringwe did not store it in any online drive)

To solve this issue, I have made this simple python project which will automatically create a `Resume` for us after will fill in the required details.
